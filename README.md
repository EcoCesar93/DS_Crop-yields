# DS_Crop-yields
Hi Folks!

1) This a project to study the relationship between external factors like weather (rain and temperature) and substances that are used to reduce the risk of a certain plague can screw up the performance of different plantations, against the evolving crop-yield across the time. Therefore, we ran different approaches to tweak, cleanup and wrangling the information coming from the yield_df.csv file which is the root where we are retrieving all the information. The idea is creating 2 Master Datasets, 1st to display all the evolution of the different crop plantations and 2nd is to display the external variables that affect the performance of the plantation. 
2) In the second phase of the project we created a log-log model to understand how the elasticities of the weathers and substances play a key role in crop forecasting, plus we continue to  export the dataset that contains all the exogenous variables across the time into a xlsx file to create and train an Arima model in RStudio, the reason behind we are flipping the environment rather than use python it's because R-language brings back more quality analysis and outcomes to get a more accurate prediction. Moreover, once the goal is reached, we proceed to export the exogenous variables to python in csv files (avg rainfall, avg temp, pesticides).
3) Finally, we circle back to python to recalibrate the estimated information and merge it with the dataset that contains the Cropâ€™s information. After applying some matrixial calculations to get the final dataset that contains the external variables updated (weather and pesticides), we noticed that some NaN values into the Cassava Column are displayed, partly because we expanded the timeframe to forecast 10 years going forward how would be performing the Cassava plantation. However, taking advantage of the log-log model developed previously we succeed to fill out the Missed values on the Cassava column to forecast accurately the performance of the crop up to 2023, same approach which is displayed in a nicely plot chart.
